JavaScript ChatGPT Clone
This is a simple chat application implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application provides a user interface for users to interact with a ChatGPT clone, which is a language model trained to generate human-like responses. Users can input messages, and the ChatGPT clone will respond with generated text.

Chat history: The application displays the chat history in the side bar.
Responsive design: The user interface is designed to work well on different devices and screen sizes.
Usage
